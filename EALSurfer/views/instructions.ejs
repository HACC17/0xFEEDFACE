                     <li>Input site Land Use, Depth of Impacted Soil and Groundwater Utility.  Check with overseeing agency to ensure that proper categories are selected.  "Unrestricted Land Use" category recommended for initial use at all sites to determine if future land use restrictions are needed. (Refer to Volume 1, Section 2.)</li>

                     <li>(optional): Input representative site chemical concentration in soil, groundwater and/or soil gas.  Surfer identifies if EALs exceeded.  Refer to Detailed EAL worksheet tab to tentatively identified environmental hazards.</li>

                     <li>Laboratory method reporting limit takes precedence if greater than the EAL (assuming standard MRL for a commercial laboratory).  Natural background concentration of metals takes precedence if greater than the EAL. (Refer to Volume 1, Section 2.9).</li>

                     <li>Determine vertical and lateral extent of soil and/or groundwater impacted above action levels to extent feasible. EALs may also be used as a guide for re-use of excavated soil.</li>

                     <li>Prepare Environmental Hazard Evaluation (EHE) with recommendations for additional actions (see Chapter 3).  Identify potential environmental hazards.  Evaluate need for corrective actions (e.g., cleanup to Tier 1 EALs, advanced evaluation of tentatively identified hazards, development of alternative cleanup levels, long-term management of contamination, need for land use restrictions and other institutional and engineering controls, closure with no further action, etc.). Refer to Chapters 4 and 5 in Volume 1of EHE guidance document and teh HEER office Technical Guidance Manual (HDOH 2009).</li>
